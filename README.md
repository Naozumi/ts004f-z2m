# TS004F-Z2M

This is a blueprint I have put together for the TS004F 4 Button Switch for use in HomeAssistant via Zigbee2Mqtt.

The actions are numbered the same as the TS0044 which I also own, which is numbered counter-clockwise from the top-left. Its a strange order but consistency is key.

Device Notes: 
  * It appears that there is no double press in the switches, nor long press on the left buttons. 
  * There is an additional action that fires when the long press stops.
  * Based on the actions from the buttons, it feels like these have been cannibalised into the 4 button switches, rather than designed specifically, which is a shame. Maybe someone will figure a way to fix this at some point...

Advice:
  * If you need only 4 buttons this works great. If you want all the actions (single, double, long) then buy the TS0044 instead.
